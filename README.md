# EC01 CSS

A set of CSS files used in this project. These files are broken down into several components to make them easier to use in various projects. The first is called `bootstrap.css`, the second `main.css`, the third `color.css`, the fourth `responsive.css`, and the fifth optional file is called `child.css`. By breaking down any project into multiple components it is easier to deal with. CSS is no exception.
