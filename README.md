# EC01 CSS

A set of CSS files used in this project. These files are broken down into several components to make them easier to use in various projects. The first is called `bootstrap.css`, the second `main.css`, the third `color.css`, the fourth `device.css`, and the fifth optional file is called `child.css`. By breaking down any project into multiple components it is easier to deal with. CSS is no exception. 

Instead of a focus on responsiveness, with smaller view screens getting priority, the css file focusing on responsiveness has been called "device.css". This is because--in most cases--the browser is at full size on the device, and larger monitors should get the recognition they deserve. In addition, device specific styling may be available and become more developed in the future (such as that dealing with landscape or portrait orientation). 

If the styling is set up correctly, each device or monitor should display the page correctly, without interfering with the other. That is the goal.
