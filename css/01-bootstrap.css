/**
 * EC01 Bootstrap CSS
 *
 * This file includes basic formatting. It specifys a san-serif font, makes the
 * links look nicer, specifies a width for the body, and a font size and line
 * height. It does not include responsive design, or additional styling of elements.
 * It may include styling in the future (such as for buttons), to bring it closer
 * in line to Bootstrap CSS {@see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/}. However,
 * it is meant to just include the basics, and so does not include all the styling
 * included there by intention. It also uses the HSL color model, which the author
 * has found *much* easier to work with, as all that is needed is a basic knowledge
 * of where the color is (from red to violet) on a circle of 360 degrees. With that
 * in place, the saturation and lightness can be adjusted with confidence, knowing
 * that the basic hue (the color) will not change. This can't be done using the RBG
 * color model or when using hex, the standard way of specifying color at the time
 * of this writing. All modern browsers support this color model
 * {@see https://caniuse.com/#search=hsl} and there are no known issues with it.
